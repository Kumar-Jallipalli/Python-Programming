## INTRO
'''
    - Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language
    - Python was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991
    - It was designed with an emphasis on code readability and its syntax allows to write concepts in fewer lines of code. → “Ease of Use”
    - Python supports ”Multi-paradigm Approach”, like object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural.
    - There are two major Python versions: **`Python 2` and `Python 3`** Both are quite different.
'''


## Python Features
'''
    - **Interpreted**
        - **No separate compilation and execution is required**
        - Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes
            - which is then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
        - No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
    - **Platform Independent**
    - **Robust**
    - **Rich Library Support**
'''


## Interpreter
'''
- an interpreter is required to interpret and run our Python Programs.
    - Online → Online interpreters like [**https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/**](https://ide.geeksforgeeks.org/) 
               can be used to run Python programs without installing an interpreter.
    - Windows → IDLE (Integrated Development Environment) that comes bundled with the Python software downloaded 
                from [**http://python.org/**](http://python.org/).
'''

## First Program
print("Happy New Year 2025..!")
'''
    - To print something on the console, `print()` function is used
    - This function also adds a newline after our message is printed(unlike in C)
'''


'''
NOTE
----
    - In Python 2, “print” is not a function but a keyword and therefore can be used without parentheses.
    - However, in Python 3, it is a function and must be invoked with parentheses.
'''


## Comments
'''
    - In Python Comments start with
        - Single Line Comments → `#`
        - Multi Line Comments → """ """
    - Comments are Ignored by Interpreter
    - Comments are used for
        - Documenting the Code
        - De-Bugging the Code

## Python (vs) Java
'''
                Python                                                  Java
                ------                                                  ----
    Dynamically Typed Language                                  Statistically Typed Language
    Uses Indentation for Structuring Code                       Uses Braces for Structuring Code
    Concise & Compact                                           Verbose & Less Compact
'''


## Python Use Cases
'''
        1. Python has also been used in artificial intelligence
        2. Python is often used for **natural language processing** tasks.
        3. GNU Debugger uses Python as a **pretty printer** to show complex structures such as C++ containers.
        4. Raspberry Pi– single board computer uses Python as its principal user-programming language
        5. Python is now being used **Game Development** areas also.
        6. A number of Linux distributions use installers written in Python example in Ubuntu we have the **Ubiquity**
