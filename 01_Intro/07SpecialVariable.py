## **__name__ (A Special variable) in Python**
'''
    - Since there is no main() function in Python,
        - when the command to run a python program is given to the interpreter,
        - the code that is at level 0 indentation is to be executed.
    - However, before doing that, it will define a few special variables.
        - `__name__` is one such special variable.
        - If the source file is executed as the main program, the interpreter sets the `__name__` variable to have a value `__main__`
        - If this file is being imported from another module, `__name__` will be set to the module's name.
    - **`__name__` is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.**
    - Thus it can be used to check whether the current script is being run on its own 
      or being imported somewhere else by combining it with if statement

# File1.py 

print ("File1 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print ("File1 is being run directly")
else: 
    print ("File1 is being imported")
    
''' 
## O/P:
        File1 __name__ = __main__
        File1 is being run directly 
'''



# File2.py 
'''
import File1

print ("File2 __name__ = %s" %__name__) 

if __name__ == "__main__": 
    print ("File2 is being run directly")
else: 
    print ("File2 is being imported")
'''


'''
## Now the interpreter is given the command to run File1.py.
python File1.py
Output :
File1 __name__ = __main__
File1 is being run directly 

## And then File2.py is run.
python File2.py
Output :
File1 __name__ = File1
File1 is being imported
File2 __name__ = __main__
File2 is being run directly 
'''


'''
    As seen above, 

    - when File1.py is run directly, the interpreter sets the __name__ variable as __main__
    - and when it is run through File2.py by importing, the __name__ variable is set as the name of the python script, i.e. File1
    - Thus, it can be said that **if __name__ == "__main__" is the part of the program that runs 
        when the script is run from the command line using a command like python File1.py.**
